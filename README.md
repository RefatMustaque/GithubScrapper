# GitHub Scraper  

## What GitHub Scraper Does  
GitHub Scraper is a bare-minimum tool with essential functionality, allowing users to download code from any public GitHub repository in one of two formats:  

### TXT File  
The tool collects all the files in the repository and packages them into a single text file. This file contains the entire codebase, which can be easily copied, viewed, or used as a reference.  

### Interactive HTML File  
The HTML format provides an interactive way to view the repository's code. Users can browse through files, search for specific code snippets, and copy individual files from the interface.  

## Key Features of GitHub Scraper  

- **Login with GitHub**: Secure authentication using GitHub’s OAuth allows users to easily log in to access public repositories.  
- **Repository Info**: After logging in, users can enter the repository owner’s name and repository name to fetch the code.  
- **Download Options**: Choose between downloading the repository as a TXT file or an interactive HTML file for easier navigation and searchability.
